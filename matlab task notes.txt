Part A

1. Load in image to be composited
2. Load in training set
3. Crop training set to appropriate scale 
	- Ratio outputwidth:output:height to Tile width divisors i.e. 600 tiles 600:1 300:2 etc.
	then scale training set widths/heights to size as close as possible
4. Histogram of each corresponding tile area on original image, build histograms of each training image, 
	- keep a store of best candidates FOREACH tile area, 
	- suplant if new training image > old training image in histogram comparison (similarity)
5. Optionally - add texture/structure etc later
6. Show the image
